# 🧩 Maze Solver Adventure (Python Project)

A Python-based maze solving visual application using *BFS algorithm* and *Tkinter GUI*.  
This project allows users to generate mazes, visualize solutions, and explore pathfinding concepts in an interactive way.

---

## 🚀 Features

- Visual maze generation and solving
- Breadth-First Search (BFS) algorithm
- Tkinter GUI with responsive layout
- Supports random and custom mazes

---

## 🧠 Algorithms Used

- *Breadth-First Search (BFS)* for shortest path solving
- Maze represented as a 2D grid (matrix of cells)

---

## 🛠 Technologies

- Python 3.x  
- Tkinter – GUI rendering  
- Queue – for BFS traversal

---
## 💡 Future Ideas  
- Add support for DFS and A* algorithms  
- Allow saving/loading custom mazes  
- Add animation speed control
